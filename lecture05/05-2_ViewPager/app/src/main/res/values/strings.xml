    <string name="article_title_1">What is Lorem Ipsum?</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph_1">
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
        been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took
        a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
        five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
        PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <string name="article_title_2">Where does it come from?</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph_2">
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece
        of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
        a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
        word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
        sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and
        Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
        popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\n
        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those
        interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero
        are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the
        1914 translation by H. Rackham.

    <string name="article_title_3">Why do we use it?</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph_3">
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
        page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \"Content here, content
        here\", making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
        editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \"lorem ipsum\"
        will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
        years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
    </string>
    <string name="article_title_4">Where can I get some?</string>
    <string name="article_paragraph_4">
        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
        suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don\'t look
        even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
        sure there isn\'t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
        with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
        The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
        non-characteristic words etc.
